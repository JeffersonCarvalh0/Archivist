# Archivist
A simple program that helps you organizing your musics

## Getting Started
Follow this instructions to install the program in your machine.

### Prerequisites
The only third-party package that's being used is [Mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
a library used to handle the files' tags in order to extract information such as
the song's band/artist and its album. To install it:

`pip install mutagen==1.40.0`

### Installing
Still working on that. For now, you can download the script.

## Usage
Currently, there are basically two ways of using it:

* Copy the script to the directory where you want your songs organized, and then
simply run the file from the command line;

* Run the script from anywhere you want, passing the directory you want your
songs organized as an argument.

## Built With
* [Mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - A Python module to handle audio metadata
